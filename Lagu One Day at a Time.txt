C                         G7
I'm only human I'm just a man

Help me believe in what I could be
               C
And all that I am
                     C7        F
Show me the stairway I have to climb
            C               G7
Lord for my sake help me to take
             C
One day at a time

[Chorus]
    C7       F
One day at a time sweet Jesus
                           C
That's all I'm asking from You
                 G
Just give me the strength to do ev'ryday
               C
What I have to do
     C7     F
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
                 D        C
And tomorrow may never be mine
             G7
Lord help me today show me the way
             C
One day at a time

[Verse]
C                                     G7
Do you remember when you walked among men
                                         F
Well Jesus you know it's worse now than then
                    C7           F
Pushin' and shovin' crowding my mind
           C                 G7
So for my sake, teach me to take
              C
One day at a time

[Chorus]
    C7       F
One day at a time sweet Jesus
                           C
That's all I'm asking from You
                 G
Just give me the strength to do ev'ryday
               C
What I have to do
     C7     F
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
                 D        C
And tomorrow may never be mine
             G7
Lord help me today show me the way
             C
One day at a time
