C                                   G7
Now the hacienda's dark the town is sleeping
        Dm                    G7           C
Now the time has come to part the time for weeping 
F                C
Vaya con Dios my darling 
    G7                 C
May God be with you my love
 
                                         G7
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing
       Dm                     G7               C
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them saying
F                C
Vaya Con Dios my darling
    G7                 C
May God be with you my love

    Gm              C         F
Wherever you may be I'll be beside you  
 Gm                          C       F
Although you're many million dreams away
     Am                        D7        G7
Each night I'll say a prayer a prayer to guide you
   Am                  D7      G7
To hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day 

        C                                  G7
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
        Gm                G7           C
But the memories we share are there to borrow 
F                C
Vaya Con Dios my darling
G7                     C
May God be with you my love
